# Link for rendered maps

In order to see the rendered maps, you can follow this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/armand33/applied_data_analysis_2017/blob/master/03%20-%20Interactive%20Viz/Homework%203.ipynb) to an online notebook viewer.

If link is dead, and to make sure you read the latest version of render, you can also go on the [notebook viewer website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the github [link](https://github.com/armand33/applied_data_analysis_2017/blob/master/03%20-%20Interactive%20Viz/Homework%203.ipynb) of our notebook.
