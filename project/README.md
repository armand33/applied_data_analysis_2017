# The new world order in perspective

# Abstract

The fall of the berlin wall in 1989, meant the cold war was coming to an end and a New World Order was to be established. Using the data set provided by UCDP, we would like to address the following question ? Has the world become a safer place ? We need to find a way to quantify 'safe' given the data that we have and finally to draw a scale of 'world safety'.

Furthermore, it seems that nowadays, the media is giving a worse image of the world. Is this accurate ?

Goal : open our eyes ? Tackle preconceived ideas about world order ? Were the US responsible for many death in Africa ? Middle East ? On the contrary local conflicts we do not hear about resulted in many many deaths ?

Today, there is an unbalance between facts and what the media tries to convey to us. We would like to clarify these numbers on the peace and war around the world. Also, we would like to expose smaller minorities which are going through the same violence process but we don't hear about. 



# Research questions
* Is the world become less and less peaceful ?
* What are the countries that underwent the most drastic shift in peace/violence ?
* Question our preconceived ideas on world peace.
* Is crime really decreasing or is it actually on a rise.


# Dataset
We will use the UCDP data set that is available online as a csv file.

This data set lists events, that is incidents of lethal violence occuring at a given time and place between january 1989 and december 2013 (excluding Syria).  All those events are quantified, that means that it gives for each event the parties involved, the number of casualties on both side, the broader conflict if there is one, the time and place and the sources that reported the event.

Each event for each event, we know exactly the longitude and latitude coordinates therefore we plot. So therefore, we can pinpoint the exact location of the event on a map. 

Data can be filtered by conflict, by actor involved, by location or by data. For example, it is easy to retrieve data that are only state conflict in which the US have been involved in Africa since 1989 is against al-Quaida and that this conflict has led to the direct death of 97 persons, among which 68 members of al-Qaida and 12 civilains.

However, the data set does not contain anything about Syria. As it is currently a burning place in world affairs, it could be great to enrich the data set in order to include these data.



# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- First of all we plan to do some data cleaning. Make sure thet the data we have available to us is all in the correct format.
- Remove from the  irrevelant columns which don't convey, interesting information.
- Since the course will involve applying machine learning as, we should think of how we would apply this to our project.
- We plan on doing thourough data exploration
