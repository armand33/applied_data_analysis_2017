# The new world order in perspective

# Abstract
The end of the cold war, that the fall of the Berlin wall announced already in 1989, meant for many that a New World Order was to be established. Using the data set provided by UCDP we would like to address the following question ? Has the world become a safer place ? We need to find a way to quantify 'safe' given the data that we have and to draw a scale of 'world safety'.

# Research questions
* Is the world become less and less peaceful ?


# Dataset
We will use the UCDP data set that is available online as a csv file.

This data set lists events, that is incidents of lethal violence occuring at a given time and place between january 1989 and december 2013 (excluding Syria).  All those events are quantified, that means that it gives for each event the parties involved, the number of casualties on both side, the broader conflict if there is one, the time and place and the sources that reported the event.

Data can be filtered by conflict, by actor involved, by location or by date. It is for example easy to get from the data that the only state conflict in which the US have been involved in Africa since 1989 is against al-Quaida and that this conflict has led to the direct death of 97 persons, among which 68 members of al-Qaida and 12 civilains.

However, the data set does not contain anything about Syria. As it is currently a burning place in world affairs, it could be great to enrich the data set in order to include these data.
