# The new world order in perspective

# Abstract

The fall of the berlin wall in 1989, meant the cold war was coming to an end and a New World Order was to be established. Using the data set provided by UCDP, we would like to address the following question : has the world become a safer place ? We need to find a way to quantify 'safe' given the data that we have and finally to draw a chronological scale of 'world safety'.

Furthermore, the perception we have of the world affairs rely strongly on the media that is available to us. Because we believe in the popular right to state and media transparency, we would like to put concrete figures on conflicts over the globe all that in the most neutral way possible. That means we will try to put in perspective the importance of well known conflict but also look for unheard conflicts of some importance.

# Research questions
* Has the post cold-war world become more or less peaceful ?
* What are the countries that underwent the most significant change in peace/violence ?
* Is our vision of world order (formed by the media we read) realistic ?

# Dataset
We will use the UCDP data set that is available online as a csv file.

This data set lists events, that is incidents of lethal violence occuring at a given time and place between january 1989 and december 2013 (excluding Syria).  All those events are quantified, that means that it gives for each event the parties involved, the number of casualties on both side, the broader conflict if there is one, the time and place and the sources that reported the event.

For each event, we know exactly the longitude and latitude coordinates therefore we plot. So therefore, we can pinpoint the exact location of the event on a map.

Data can be filtered by type of violence (state-based, one-sided), general conflict, actor involved, location or date. For example, it is easy to retrieve data on the state conflicts in which the US has been involved in Africa since 1989. There is only one, against al-Quaida and it has led to the direct death of 97 persons, among which 68 members of al-Qaida and 12 civilians.

However, the data set does not contain anything about Syria. As it is currently a burning place in world affairs, it could be great to enrich the data set in order to include it.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Data exploration : measure the full extent of the data set and the enventual gaps in it.
- Data cleaning : selected relevant data, fill the eventual gaps and format the data in a handful manner.
- Statistics responding to our first two question should be available by milestone 2.
- Define more precisely the angle in which we want to tell our data story depending on the findings of data exploration.

# Questions for TAa
- Is there any similar data set on Syria or covering 2013 to nowadays ?
- If yes can we enrich our data set using those ?
